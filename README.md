Student Performance Prediction
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting student academic performance using machine learning techniques. The objective is to identify key factors influencing student success and build predictive models to classify performance outcomes.

📊 Dataset

Student academic and demographic data

Includes academic scores and personal attributes

Target variable: Pass / Fail

⚙️ Technologies Used

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed relationships between academic scores and performance

Visualized data distributions and feature correlations

Identified important features influencing student results

🤖 Machine Learning Models

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

Models were trained using an 80–20 train-test split and evaluated using accuracy metrics.

📈 Results

Compared multiple models to determine prediction accuracy

Interpreted feature importance to understand model decisions

🚀 Future Improvements
